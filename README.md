  ## Usage
  This application has links in the navigation bar that display the corresponding page. Each project in the Work section contains a GitHub link that opens the GitHub repo in a separate tab as well as a link to the deployed application which is accessed by clicking on the project itself. The Resume section displays a link to a google doc that also opens in a separate tab. The footer of the page contains links to my Github, LinkedIn, and HackerRank pages. Lastly, the Contact Me page displays a form which can be used to send me a message via email.<br><br>
